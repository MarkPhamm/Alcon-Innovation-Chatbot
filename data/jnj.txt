About multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.
In multiple myeloma, these plasma cells proliferate and spread rapidly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow with tumors.
Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer worldwide and remains an incurable disease.
In 2024, it was estimated that more than 35,000 people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the U.S. and more than 12,000 people would die from the disease.
People living with multiple myeloma have a 5-year survival rate of 59.8 percent.
While some people diagnosed with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels and kidney problems or infections.
6,7
About smoldering multiple myeloma
Smoldering multiple myeloma is an asymptomatic precursor state to multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with SMM have higher levels of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and an elevated monoclonal protein (M-protein) level in the blood, but they do not yet exhibit the symptoms commonly associated with active multiple myeloma, particularly end-organ damage. Fifteen percent of all cases of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma are classified as smoldering multiple myeloma, and half of those diagnosed with high-risk disease will progress to active multiple myeloma within two years.
About warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia
Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is a rare, life-threatening condition where autoantibodies lead to the premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in anemia, which can cause symptoms like debilitating fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, jaundice and in severe cases, chest pain or loss of consciousness.
Approximately 1-3 new people per 100,000 are affected by wAIHA per year, and about 1 in 8,000 individuals are living with the condition.9
,10
This condition affects both women and men and can affect people at any age with incidence increasing over the age of 50.10
,11
There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs indicated for wAIHA, and treatment typically consists of corticosteroids, broad immunosuppressants and B-cell directed therapies.9 With an unmet need for treatment in wAIHA, continued research for evidence-based potential therapies is critical.
About fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a rare and potentially life-threatening alloimmune condition in which a pregnant person’s immune system develops alloantibodies against fetal or newborn platelet antigens, leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the fetus or newborn.
FNAIT can result in severe bleeding complications for a fetus or newborn and is characterized by organ bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or eyes.13 If a severe bleed occurs in the brain, termed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), death or life-long neurologic effects may occur.13
ICH occurs in up to 26 percent of untreated pregnancies with FNAIT.
It has an estimated incidence rate of 1 in 1000 pregnancies.
13,15
There are no approved therapies for the treatment of FNAIT. Because FNAIT is not routinely screened for during pregnancy, the diagnosis of an affected FNAIT pregnancy often occurs postnatally.13
About DARZALEX
and DARZALEX
(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj)
received
U.S. FDA approval in May 2020 and is approved for nine indications in multiple myeloma, four of which are for frontline treatment in newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible or ineligible.
It is the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with MM. DARZALEX
is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20, Halozyme’s ENHANZE
drug delivery technology.
(daratumumab) received
U.S. FDA approval
in November 2015 and is approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible and ineligible.
is the first CD38-directed antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma.17 DARZALEX
-based regimens have been used in the treatment of more than 585,000 patients worldwide and more than 239,000 patients in the U.S. alone.
In
August 2012
, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab AS entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab.
Since 2020, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN
) has recommended daratumumab-based combination regimens for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
†
For newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in non-transplant candidates, the NCCN
guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 1 preferred regimen; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone as another recommended Category 1 regimen; and daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone as another recommended Category 2A regimen. For newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in transplant candidates, the NCCN
guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as another recommended Category 2A regimen; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances; daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances; and daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances. For maintenance in transplant candidates, the NCCN
guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide as useful in certain circumstances. In relapsedrefractory myeloma, four daratumumab regimens are listed as Category 1 preferred regimens for early relapses (1-3 prior therapies): daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone; daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone; and daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone [after one prior therapy including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor]. The NCCN
also recommends daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone as another Category 2A regimen for early relapses (1-3 prior therapies) and as monotherapy as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances for early relapse patients after at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or for patients who are double refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.

About CARVYKTI
CARVYKTI
is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy that involves reprogramming a patient’s own T-cells with a transgene encoding chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that directs the CAR-positive T cells to eliminate cells that express BCMA. BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. The CARVYKTI
CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domains designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells.
(cilta-cel) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval
in February 2022 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. In April 2024, CARVYKTI
was
approved
in the U.S. fortreatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and who are refractory to lenalidomide, following a unanimous (11 to 0) FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommendation in support of this new indication. In April 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
a Type II variation for CARVYKTI
for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor, have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, and are refractory to lenalidomide.
In December 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Legend Biotech USA, Inc. to develop and commercialize CARVYKTI

Since FDA approval, 1,800 patients were treated with TALVEY
. The European Commission (EC) granted
(CMA) of TALVEY
(talquetamab-tgvs) in August 2023 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.
is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody that binds to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), a novel multiple myeloma target which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and non-malignant plasma cells, as well as some healthy tissues such as epithelial cells of the skin and tongue.
About IMBRUVICA
IMBRUVICA
(ibrutinib) is a once-daily oral medication that is jointly developed and commercialized by Janssen Biotech, Inc., and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. IMBRUVICA
blocks the BTK protein, which is needed by normal and abnormal B cells, including specific cancer cells, to multiply and spread. By blocking BTK, IMBRUVICA
may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments and inhibit their proliferation.
21,22,23
is approved in more than 100 countries and has been used to treat more than 300,000 patients worldwide over the last decade. There are more than 50 company-sponsored clinical trials, including 18 Phase 3 studies, spanning more than 11 years evaluating the efficacy and safety of IMBRUVICA
was first approved by the U.S. FDA in November 2013, and today is indicated for adult patients in four disease areas. These include indications to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemiasmall lymphocytic lymphoma with or without 17p deletion; adults with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia; and adult and pediatric patients aged one year and older with previously treated chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.
About Nipocalimab
Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without impact on other immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Prevalent Rheumatology.
25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33
Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.
34,35
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including:
· U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and wAIHA in July 2019, gMG in December 2021 and FNAIT in March 2024
